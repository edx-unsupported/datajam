<h1> The Datajam Insights application is running.</h1>

<p> If a datajam LMS is also running, it should be sending events that
an event handler in the datajam Insights will store in a mongo
database.

<p> To verify, connect to the database, and see what events are there: 
<pre>
$ mongo
MongoDB shell version: 2.0.4
connecting to: test
> show dbs
...
modules_dump_to_db
...
> use modules_dump_to_db
switched to db modules_dump_to_db
> show collections
event_log
system.indexes
> db.event_log.find()

[ should show all events sent to database ]
</pre>
<p> Query connectivity may be checked by going to the datajam LMS,
logging in as an instructor of a course (such as the demo course),
navigating to the analytics tab of the instructor dash, and verifying
that fabricated data from Insights appears there.
